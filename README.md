## classSTI - A project to predict instances of bacterial STIs
### William Patterson

This is the code repository for my senior thesis at Brown University for the Sc. B. in Translational Epidemiology.

Many thanks to Drs. Neil Sarkar, Philip Chan, and Brandon Marshall for insight, advice, and revision help.


This thesis set out to:

- Develop clinical decision support models for predicting bacterial STI test outcomes
- Systematically explore variables captured in the Rhode Island STD clinic's intake form for prediction
- Explore the utility of statistical and machine learning models for clinical model building
